# Code for the Scheduling Feature of the WMS 
#
# This feature allows waste collection companies to create and manage
# collection schedules. It ensures that bins are emptied at optimal times
# based on historical data and current fill levels. 
# The scheduling system can: 
#  > Automatically generate collection schedules. 
#  > Adjust schedules dynamically based on real-time data.
#  > Notify operators of upcoming collections and any changes.
