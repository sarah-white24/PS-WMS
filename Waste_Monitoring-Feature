# Code for the Waste Monitoring Feature of the WMS 
#
# This feature involves tracking the fill levels of bins using IoT sensors. 
# It helps in identifying which nins need to be collected sooner and which 
# areas generate more waste. 
# Waste monitoring can: 
#  > Provide real-time data on bin fill levels.
#  > Send alerts when bins are nearly full. 
#  > Analyse waste generation patterns over time.
