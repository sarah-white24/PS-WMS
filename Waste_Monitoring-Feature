# Code for the Waste Monitoring Feature of the WMS 
#
# This feature involves tracking the fill levels of bins using IoT sensors. 
# It helps in identifying which nins need to be collected sooner and which 
# areas generate more waste. 
# Waste monitoring can: 
#  > Provide real-time data on bin fill levels.
#  > Send alerts when bins are nearly full. 
#  > Analyse waste generation patterns over time. 
#
# Implementation Steps --> 
#  1. Sensor Installation: Install IoT sensors in bins to monitor fill levels. 
#  2. Data Transmission: Use wireless communication (e.g. LoRaWAN, GSM) to 
#     transmit data to a central server. 
#  3. Data Processing: Process the data to determine bin fill levels and 
#     predict when bins will be full. 
#  4. Alerts: Set up alerts to notify operators when bins are nearly full. 
#  5. Dashboard: Create a dashboard to display real-time bin status.
