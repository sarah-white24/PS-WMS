# Code for the Route Optimisation Feature 
#
# Route optimisation is crucial for minimising travel time and fuel 
# consumption. This feature uses algorithms to determine the most efficient
# routes for waste collection trucks. 
# It can: 
#  > Calculate the shortest and fastest routes. 
#  > Consider factors like traffic conditions, road closures, and bin 
#    fill levels. 
#  > Provide real-time route adjustments to avoid delays.
